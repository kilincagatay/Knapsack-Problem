# Knapsack-Problem
This  famous  problem  is  usually  stated  as  follows: Given  a  set  of  items, each  with  a  weight  and  a  value,  determine  which  items  to  include  in  a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. We formulate and develop a solution to the knapsackproblem as a local search problem, using simpleai library.
